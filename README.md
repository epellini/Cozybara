# Cozybara
A virtual pet game developed with Unity and programmed in C#! In this game, players take on the role of a capybara caretaker, responsible for the care and growth of their digital capybara companion. In the game, you can nurture your capybara through activities such as feeding, grooming, resting, and playing mini-games to keep your pet entertained. Made using Unity Engine 2D & C#.

## Features
**Pet Care Mechanics:** Take care of your capybara by feeding it, washing it, and ensuring it gets enough sleep. Pay attention to its needs to keep it healthy and content.

**Interactive Mini-Games:** Engage in mini-games to keep your pet entertained. Games are similar to Whac-A-Mole and T-Rex Runner.

## Why this project?
I had the opportunity to create this game in Unity in just 5 days, alongside my friend [Hyunjin](https://github.com/icecreamp), during the [VARLab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/varlab-virtual-and-augmented-reality-lab/?originalSubdomain=ca) 2023 Code Jam. This experience was amazing, and it truly made me appreciate the dedication, hard work, and passion that game developers pour into their creations. This project allowed to learn more about the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/), hone my C# skills and get a good hands-on experience in a collaborative environment with my teammate.
